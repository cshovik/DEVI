## 🔥 Features

✅ **Violence Detection** - Identifies aggressive behavior in real time.\
✅ **Weapon Recognition** - Detects firearms using advanced object detection.\
✅ **Gender Classification** - Determines gender for security profiling.\
✅ **Audio-based Distress Detection** - Recognizes distress signals with **99.11% accuracy**.\
✅ **SOS Hand Gesture Recognition** - Detects universal **SOS** hand signals.\
✅ **Real-Time Alerts & Law Enforcement Integration** - Sends **live video feeds** to authorities.\
✅ **Geofencing & Mobile Alerts** - Notifies users when entering high-risk zones.

## 📌 Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/its-manishks/DIVA.git
cd DIVA

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables (.env file)

# Run the backend server
npm start

# Start the frontend application
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

## 🎯 How It Works

1️⃣ User enters a danger zone → Receives an SMS alert.\
2️⃣ No response? Law enforcement is notified.\
3️⃣ CCTV footage is processed in real time for threat detection.\
4️⃣ Audio & visual distress signals are analyzed.\
5️⃣ Authorities receive live alerts & video feeds for immediate action.

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model                         | Precision | Recall | mAP             |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | ------ | --------------- |
| Gender Classification         | 1.00      | 0.97   | 0.925           |
| Violence Detection            | 0.959     | 0.98   | 0.880           |
| Weapon Detection              | 0.942     | 0.67   | 0.537           |
| Audio-based Emotion Detection | -         | -      | 99.11% Accuracy |

## ⚠️ Challenges & Future Work

🔹 **Infrastructure Limitations** - Requires high-speed internet & robust surveillance networks.\
🔹 **Government Collaboration** - Needs partnerships with law enforcement & telecom providers.\
🔹 **Scalability** - Optimizing models for large-scale real-time deployment.\
🔹 **Privacy & Security** - Strengthening data security measures.
